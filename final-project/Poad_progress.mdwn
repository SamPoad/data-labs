# Progress Log

Project began on Feb 25, 2020

Decided to use a Malaria Dataset
<br> taken from https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932

the plan is to use this dataset to build a predictive model on whether a new entry has malaria or not.

Domain knowledge a bit to go into the staining process to identify malaria in cells, and then how to address visually.

Interesting thing to note about the data
* The CSV file for the uninfected class contains 201 entries since the normal cells from the infected patientsâ€™ slides also make it to the normal cell category (151+50 = 201)

Remember that this will all be a Python file eventually, so pickle the model that you settle on. 

plan - start a Jupyter notebook for relevant sections

Day 1 target - read the images as arrays, take this data and store as a SQL database.
(this will show Python knowledge)
one table as infected, another table as uninfected

Read in the SQL data to start the model (show SQL knowledge)
concat the dataframes and create a target column to identify Malaria (1) or not (0)

the Features of the dataset will be the array information itself.

Review the image processing / neural network lesson - do i need to reduce the complexity of the images at all? 
My images are very small, and few colors, but I have 27.5k of them to process.

Get an overall sense of SIZE of the data. roughtly 28,000 images at what pixel height/width? 

Day 1 - ran into - how to get these images into their array of pixel values? 
research: 



Day 2 target - read the SQL together, and concat the dataframes to create the dataset I need to be using.
